# Assignment Prerequisites
Please go over the mandatory prerequisites below.

* [Working Environment](#working-environment)
* [Home Assignment Submission](#home-assignment-submission)

## Working Environment
- AWS Account - learn how to create your account [here](../../materials/account.md)
- Account access authorizations - learn how to configure aws authorizations on your workstation/server [here](../../materials/account.md)
- [Terraform Cloud Account](https://app.terraform.io/signup/account?utm_source=terraform_io&utm_content=terraform_cloud_top_nav) 
- [Install terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) client on your workstation
> Note: It is better practice to use an EC2 instance with an IAM role as your workstation.
- You should use an AWS CLI profile that uses an IAM role to apply your project and not by exposing AWS credentials variables.    [Read here how to create and associate an IAM role with your AWS Local CLI profile.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html)

## Home Assignment Submission
Submit your assignment in a github repo. Create an **AWS and Terraform** repo and then a **Homework4** directory.
